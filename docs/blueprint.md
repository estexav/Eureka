- Primary color: Warm orange (#FF9933), reminiscent of freshly baked bread, to evoke comfort and appetite.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), providing a soft and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted brown (#8B4513), an analogous color to orange that complements it to add a touch of rustic charm.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' for a clean and modern look.
- Use line-based icons related to baking and ingredients. For the low stock alerts use simple warning icons.
- The layout should be clean and intuitive, with easy-to-navigate sections for recipes, ingredients, sales entry, and stock overview.
- Subtle animations for feedback and loading states (e.g., a subtle loading animation when stock levels are recalculated).
